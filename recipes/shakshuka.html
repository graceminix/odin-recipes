    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Shakshouka (Arabic: شكشوكة, also spelled shakshuka or chakchouka) is a Maghrebi dish of eggs poached in a sauce of tomatoes, olive oil, peppers, onion and garlic, commonly spiced with cumin, paprika and cayenne pepper.</p>
    <p>According to Joan Nathan, shakshouka originated in Ottoman North Africa in the mid-16th century after tomatoes were introduced to the region by Hernan Cortés as part of the Columbian exchange.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 onion</li>   
        <li>3 tomatoes</li> 
        <li>6 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>1 bell pepper</li> 
        <li>1 15-oz can of chickpeas</li>
        <li>2 tbsp curry powder</li>
        <li>2 tsp oregano</li>  
        <li>salt, to taste</li>
        <li>pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
        <li>1 package feta cheese</li>
        <li>bread, for dipping (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>First, mince the onion and garlic.  To a pan on medium heat with some oil, heat both until the onion is soft and translucent, about 4 minutes.</li>    
        <li>Dice the bell pepper and add it to the pan.  Cook for a few minutes until it is slightly softened.</li>
        <li>Roughly chop the tomatoes and add them to the pan.  Let them cook down for about ten minutes, until the tomatoes are very soft and most of the juices are a sauce.</li> 
        <li>Add chickpeas to the pan, as well as the curry, oregano, salt and pepper.</li>  
        <li>Add the four eggs to the pan, and cover the pan.  Let the eggs cook and then enjoy with bread and feta!</li>  
    </ol>
