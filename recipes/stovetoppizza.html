    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pizza (Italian: [ˈpittsa], Neapolitan: [ˈpittsə]) is a dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients (such as anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, pineapple, meat, etc.), which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.[1] A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta. A person who makes pizza is known as a pizzaiolo.</p>
    <p>Stovetop pizza is a way to make pizza at home if you don't have an over, or if it is simply too hot to use one!</p>  
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Pizza dough</li> 
        <li>Tomato sauce</li>   
        <li>2 cups mozzerella cheese</li>
        <li>Whatever pizza toppings you like!</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>First, roll out your pizza dough.  To a lightly oiled pan on medium heat, put the pizza dough in the pan and put a lid on the pan.</li>
        <li>After the first side has a bit of color, flip the dough and let it cook on the other side for a bit longer.</li>    
        <li>Flip the pizza again. Top the pizza with sauce, then cheese, and then your toppings.  Put a lid back on the pizza.</li>   
        <li>Once the cheese is melted, enjoy!</li>
